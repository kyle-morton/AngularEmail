-uses the single page application idealogy (0 page refreshes)
	the html needed is injected into the ng-view element

-angular.module('myApp', []) -> creates new module (NAMESPACE) called 'myApp' and returns
								it so you can assign it vars, functions
							 -> [] is used to path names of other modules as dependencies
							 -> with the array arg, the function becomes a getter for 'myApp'
							 
-routing -> use $routeProvider to inject the correct html when certain route reached
		    EX. when at /inbox, inject inbox.html which inits it's controller
			
$routeProvider is a seperate library from core angular, must be included in project file
***$routeProvider version should MATCH your angular version

-once $routeProvided included, we can use ngRoute and pass as dependency in our module!
 	EX. var app = angular.module('app', [
								'ngRoute'
								]);
								
-you can dynamically assign controllers to html elements

**modules have a .config() function that is run before most other function callbacks.
	-This is where we can config the routes, set up controllers, etc!
	
	//app.config(function() {/*....*/});
